Let's be honest. Everyone's tired of these so called "community projects" with stupid names. They claim to have things on their roadmap like dApps, NFTs, gaming integration, or a whole new crypto utopia. They will write a crappy whitepaper, shill for a bit, have a few awkward AMAs, promise the moon, and then stagnate -- only to fade into obscurity.

Enter USELESS TOKEN -- the token that transparently offers investors no value. So no whitepaper, no expectations, no FUD, no AMAs, no whiny community, and no care in the world. This will either go to the moon -- because fate loves irony -- or you get a trophy of useless tokens in your wallet for some sweet bragging rights. Win-win!
